1.6 (2013-12-26)
  * New 'power.roc.test' function for sample size and power computations

  * Introducing various algorithms to compute sensitivities and specificites, with a more vectorized code or Rcpp. See 'algorithm' in ?roc for more details on the trade-offs of the different methods.
  * Faster algorithm for DeLong 'roc.test', 'ci', 'var' and 'cov' function (thanks Kazuki Yoshida).
  * 'are.paired' now also checks for identical 'levels'
  * Fixed a warning generated in the examples
  * Fixed several bugs related with 'smooth.roc' curves
  * Additional input data sanity checks
  * Now requires R >= 2.13 (in fact, since 1.5.1, thanks Emmanuel Curis for the report)
  * Progress bars now defaults to text on Macs where 'tcltk' seems broken (thanks Gerard Smits for the report)

1.5.4 (2012-08-31)
  * Running less smooth.roc examples with logcondens because they take too much time (requested by Uwe Ligges)

1.5.3 (2012-08-31)
  * AUC specification was lost when roc.test, cov or var was passed an 'auc' object.
  * Correct computation of "accuracy" in 'coords' (thanks to Kosuke Yoshihara for the report)

1.5.1 (2012-03-09)
  * Faster loading of the package (thanks to Prof Brian Ripley and Glenn Lawyer for the report)

1.5 (2011-12-11)
  * New 'cov' and 'var' functions
  * 'coords' accepts new 'ret' values: "accuracy", "tn", "tp", "fn", "fp", "npv", "ppv", "1-specificity", "1-sensitivity", "1-npv", "1-ppv", "npe" and "ppe"
  * New 'legacy.axes' argument to 'plot' 1-specificity rather than specificity
  * New 'axes' argument to turn off the plotting of the axis
  * New 'logcondens' and 'logcondens.smooth' (Univariate Log-Concave Density Estimation) smoothing methods
  * New function 'has.partial.auc' to determine if an AUC is full or partial
  * New argument 'drop' for 'coords'
  * 'auc' and 'multiclass.auc' objects now also have secondary class 'numeric'
  * Updated load call
  * Delong's CI reversed in ROC curves with direction=">"
  * Delong's CI AUC returned values > 1 or < 0 in some rare cases
  * Minor improvements in documentation

1.4.4 (2011-08-09)
  * Fixed alternative for one-tailed tests
  * Removed COPYING file to fix a warning in r-devel.

1.4.3 (2011-03-17)
  * Updated citation

1.4.2 (2011-03-03)
  * Fixed bootstrap 'roc.test' generating NAs when 'smooth.roc's were used with 'reuse.auc=FALSE' (thanks to Buddy for the report)
  * Documented a warning that was missing in roc.test
  * Updated citation
  
1.4.1 (2011-01-27)
  * 'venkatraman''s test for unpaired ROC curves
  
1.4 (2011-01-21)
  * 'smooth' does not apply on 'ordered' factors anymore
  * Multi-class AUC support
  * Can choose how 'best' thresold is determined ('best.method' and 'best.weights' in 'coords' and 'print.thres.best.method' and 'print.thres.best.weights' in 'plot.roc')
  * Minor fixes in documentation
  * 'print' now prints the response instead of "response" and more informative data in 'htest's
  * Bootstrap with 'ci.auc' consumes much less memory
  * Unpaired bootstrap and DeLong's test
  * Specificity and sensitivity tests (in 'roc.test')

1.3.2 (2010-08-24)
  * 'print.auc' printed incorrect CI in 'plot.roc' (thanks to Alexander B. Leichtle for the report)
  * Failed to detect local maximas in 'coords' when 2 or less points were selected
  * Don't consider ROC extremities (+-Inf at 1.0/0.0 SE<->SP) as local maximas

1.3.1 (2010-08-18)
  * Sensitivity and specificity were inverted in coords when results were reported as list
  * Faster checks with '\dontrun{}' in 'roc.test'

1.3 (2010-08-13)
  * '...' not passed correctly in 'plot.ci.se' with 'type="bars"' resulting in an error
  * CI is not re-computed by default in 'smooth.roc'. You can still turn it on with 'reuse.ci=TRUE'
  * New function 'are.paired'
  * Local maximas could be incorrectly detected in 'coords' (and 'plot.roc') with 'predictor's containing more than 2 levels.
  * New method 'venkatraman' for 'roc.test'
  * MASS and tcltk packages are now only suggested instead of required

1.2.1 (2010-05-11)
  * Handle 'method' arguments for 'smooth.roc' and 'ci.auc' separately in 'roc.default'
  * Added 'auc.polygon.*' and 'max.auc.polygon.*' arguments for 'polygon' in 'plot.roc'

1.2 (2010-05-09)
  * Added DeLong method in 'ci.auc'
  * Return value of 'ci.auc' does not contain an 'aucs' item anymore
  * Put most examples with bootstrap within '\dontrun{}' blocks for faster (but less useful) checks execution

1.1 (2010-05-05)
  * Added 'lines.roc' functions for ROC
  * Added 'type' argument for both 'lines.roc' and 'plot.roc'
  * Added 'print.auc.col' argument to 'plot.roc'
  * Fixed a warning in 'roc.test.default' when the class of 'predictor1' had several elements
  * Fixed an encoding failure during the checks on MacOS X

1.0.1 (2010-04-28)
  * Reduced examples execution time. Added low 'boot.n' in the slowest examples and 'reuse.auc' and 'reuse.ci' arguments in smooth.roc.roc

1.0 (2010-04-27)
  * First public release
